## Introduction

The Elder Patient Tracking System (EPTS) is a sophisticated solution designed to monitor and detect instances of falls among elderly residents in retirement communities. Leveraging deep learning techniques and real-time video analysis, the system offers timely alerts to caregivers, ensuring swift intervention and assistance in case of fall events.

## System Components

The Elder Patient Tracking System comprises the following components:

1. **Training Module (`train.py`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Trains a deep learning model to detect falls using monocular camera images.
   - **Dependencies**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, ImageDataGenerator
   - **Usage**: Execute the `train.py` script to train the model using the provided training dataset.

2. **Fall Detection Module (`simck.py`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Implements real-time fall detection using a trained deep learning model.
   - **Dependencies**: TensorFlow, OpenCV
   - **Usage**: Run the `simck.py` script to initialize the fall detection system, which captures video frames from a camera feed and makes predictions using the trained model.
   - **Additional Functionality**: The system sends SMS alerts using a GSM module connected to the device, ensuring timely notifications to caregivers. Make sure the GSM module is properly connected and configured for sending messages.

3. **Camera Interface Module (`camra.py`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles the interaction with the camera device for capturing video frames.
   - **Dependencies**: OpenCV
   - **Usage**: The `camra.py` module provides functions to initialize the camera and capture frames for fall detection.

4. **Model Evaluation Module (`evaluate.py`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Evaluates the performance of the trained fall detection model using a test dataset.
   - **Dependencies**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, ImageDataGenerator
   - **Usage**: Execute the `evaluate.py` script to assess the accuracy and other performance metrics of the trained model.

## System Setup

1. **Dependencies Installation**:
   - Ensure all required dependencies are installed in your environment. Refer to the Dependencies section for details.

2. **Dataset Preparation**: 
   - Prepare a dataset containing images of elderly individuals in various poses, including falls and non-falls, for training the model.

3. **Model Training**: 
   - Run the `train.py` script to train the fall detection model using the prepared dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Optionally, use the `evaluate.py` script to evaluate the performance of the trained model on a test dataset.

5. **System Deployment**: 
   - Deploy the trained model and related modules (`simck.py`, `camra.py`) in the target environment, such as a retirement community facility.

## Running the System

1. **Fall Detection Module**:
   - Execute the `simck.py` script to initialize the fall detection system.
   - Ensure that the camera device is connected and accessible.
   - The system will capture video frames from the camera feed, analyze them using the trained model, and provide real-time fall detection alerts.
   - Additionally, the system sends SMS alerts using a GSM module connected to the device, ensuring timely notifications to caregivers. Make sure the GSM module is properly connected and configured for sending messages.
